				<h3>Renewable fuel production against bees</h3>
				America’s honeybees are dying off, and one reason why could be widespread federal policies meant to help the environment—that have backfired.

				Bees are the primary pollinators for US crops. Melons, oranges, broccoli, almonds—you name it, and it probably requires bees. But farmers rarely have their own bee colonies on their property, and fewer still can rely on nearby wild bees to pollinate their crops. So they rent them—and nearly half of all commercial bees come from North and South Dakota.

				<h3>Bees are dying and so are we</h3>
				This can also sort of count as a subcategory to “Food”. Through bees, a flower’s pollen gets transported to other flowers, which helps them to make seeds and reproduce. Not only does no bees equal significantly less flowers, but 70% of fruits, nuts, and vegetables that we consume on a daily basis also rely on cross-pollination to grow and produce. Watermelons, apples, cherries, almonds, broccoli, and asparagus being just a few examples.

				This was really first addressed in 2006 (ten years ago!) when beekeepers noticed that their bee populations had started to decrease significantly. According to globalresearch.ca, between the years of 2009-2014, 30% of bee population has disappeared, as well as nearly one third of the bee colonies in the United States, and it doesn’t look like it’s stopping any time soon.


				Climate change is believed to be a big reason as to why populations are decreasing so rapidly. Not only are bees losing more and more of their habitat each year, but harsher winters have begun to stay freezing longer, overlapping well into springtime. Along with that, in summertime, more and more people are spraying pesticides and insecticides to rid their yards of pesky insects like ants, or mosquitoes. The problem with this, as demonstrated by the recent actions of South Carolina’s Dorchester County, is that — SURPRISE! — insecticides also kill bees.
